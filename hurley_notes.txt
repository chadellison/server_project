notes on Hurley
install hurley
check 1511 slack channel
require hurley

require "Hurley" in pry
require "Socket" in pry

hurley is mimicking your server
it communicates the thing you put on line and outputs it
you will ping the server
and it will get sent and stored in a variable so you
can manipulate it
use Hurley.get("localhost:9292")
Hurley returns the output you would get in your browser

you can ping the server from your ruby code instead of from
your browser

you use the .get function to

client.get "/user ..." <-- this goes after initial url
client.get " " do |req|
  req.url
end
